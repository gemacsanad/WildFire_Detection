# Wildfire Detection Using Satellite Images
## Gema Csan√°d

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting wildfires in satellite images. 
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of images labeled as **wildfire** and **no-wildfire**. 
Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, resizing, and color adjustments are applied to enhance the model's generalization. 
The project will explore challenges such as distinguishing smoke from clouds and handling images where fire is not visibly apparent.
The outcome of this project will be a trained model capable of detecting wildfires from satellite imagery in real time.

# Wildfire Detection Using Satellite Images
## Gema Csan√°d

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting wildfires in satellite images. 
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of images labeled as **wildfire** and **no-wildfire**. 
The outcome of this project will be a trained model capable of detecting wildfires from satellite imagery.

## File structure

- **data_loading.ipynb:** Downloads the dataset from Kaggle, preprocesses the images, and saves the data to `.npy` files  
- **small_model.ipynb:** Code for the first, really small model  
- **small_model.h5:** First, really small model  
- **medium_model.ipynb:** Code for medium sized model  
- **medium_model.h5:** Medium model  
- **final_model.ipynb:** Code for the final model  
- **final_model.h5:** Final model  
- **Documentation.pdf:** Written report of the project  
- **GUI.py:** GUI for the project  
- **requirements.txt:** List of all packages with versions  
- **presentation folder:** Contains the presentations for the project  




## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository to your machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gemacsanad/WildFire_Detection/
    cd WildFire_Detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the dataset:**  
    Run the `GUI.py` script.
    ```bash
    python GUI.py
    ```
